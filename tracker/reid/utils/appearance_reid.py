appearance_reid.py
------------------
Lightweight appearance-based re-identification for player tracking.

Maintains a per-track gallery of normalised HSV colour histograms extracted
from the torso region of each player bounding box.  When BoT-SORT issues a
brand-new track ID for a player who had disappeared (its ``track_buffer``
expired), ``AppearanceReIDMatcher.rematch`` compares the new detection's
histogram against the gallery and re-assigns the original ID if the cosine
similarity exceeds ``similarity_threshold``.

Design rationale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **HSV histograms** are robust to minor lighting changes and pose variation,
  cheap to compute (< 0.1 ms per crop on CPU), and capture jersey colour well.
* **Torso-only crop** (upper 15 %–60 % of bbox) removes the pitch background,
  feet, and ball from the appearance descriptor.
* **Exponential moving average** (α=0.7 old + 0.3 new) smoothly updates each
  active track's appearance model without storing many frames of history.
* **Gallery TTL** prunes lost tracks after ``gallery_ttl`` frames so stale
  entries do not cause false matches (default 90 frames ≈ 3 s at 30 fps).
* **Hungarian assignment** is used when multiple new IDs could match the same
  gallery entry; the globally optimal 1-to-1 assignment is selected.
* **YOLO backbone features** (optional): when the caller provides per-track
  L2-normalised FPN feature vectors extracted by
  :class:`~segmentation_tracking.yolo_features.YOLOFeatureExtractor`, these
  are stored alongside the HSV histogram and blended into the similarity score
  during re-matching.  The blend weight is controlled by ``yolo_feat_weight``.
  When YOLO features are unavailable for either gallery or candidate track, the
  matcher falls back to HSV-only similarity seamlessly.

Public API
~~~~~~~~~~
``AppearanceReIDMatcher(gallery_ttl, similarity_threshold, yolo_feat_weight)``
    Constructor.

``update_active(track_id, frame, bbox, yolo_feat=None)``
    Call every frame for each visible track to maintain its appearance model.
    ``yolo_feat`` is an optional L2-normalised float32 feature vector from
    :class:`~segmentation_tracking.yolo_features.YOLOFeatureExtractor`.

``notify_lost(lost_ids, last_bboxes)``
    Call when tracks disappear; moves their appearance into the gallery.

``rematch(new_track_ids, frame, bboxes, yolo_feats=None) -> dict[int, int]``
    Returns ``{new_id: old_id}`` for IDs that were successfully re-identified.
    ``yolo_feats`` is an optional ``{track_id: feature_vector}`` dict for the
    candidate new tracks.

``age_gallery(current_track_ids)``
    Ages gallery entries and removes expired ones.  Call at end of each frame.

``reset()``
    Clear all state (call at the start of each new video).
